**GBPCHF pair has been in consolidation pattern since December 24th, 2019 where it found support at 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement after a Pullback from 1.32960, December 13th High. Since then, the market has been trending within a narrow channel between 200MA as support level and 1.280 Long Term Resistance level. Concurrently, the Momentum has been building consistently up from negative -0.04 to recent break above the zero mark which has propelled GBPCHF to break above 1.280 Resistance . The question now is, does the market have ample fuel to maintain a sustained breakout and head to challenge Long Term Resistance at 1.340.**
